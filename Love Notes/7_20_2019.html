        <p>Dear Juul Podia,</br></br>
        You are probably working hard at Harmony right now as I am typing this letter
        (I am working hard at work, too! On this love letter haha). I just wanted to write
        you a quick brainchild because I absolutely adore the heckle out of you, and
        I always want you to know it. I'd like to apologize for how tinky I can be sometimes.
        I am tooting so much today and every single toot is so super stinky (not tinky, STINKY). So,
        I apologize for all the toots I do around you that smell worse than smelly. You are never
        a tinky girl no matter how many times I call you one haha. Also, it is crazy how much we
        still use that word after coining it in Savannah. You smell so good without even trying.
        I will compliment you and you will say something like, "No, I haven't even showered yet!" or
        "Jordan, I'm not even wearing makeup." You are effortlessly beautiful :) I know you don't
        see yourself that way a lot of the time, but I see you as a star shining brighter than any
        other. You really are MY morning sun. Does the sun wear makeup or take showers? Nope, and yet,
        the sun is still GLOWING and RADIATING just like you :) I hope work goes well, and I hope
        you don't have to call 911 for any of your lovely residents today. This job of yours can
        probably be a toll on your health as it is very stressful at times. I think that no matter
        where you end up working in the future, you will have a profession where you can help others.
        You are just the kind of person that finds happiness from other people's happiness, and that
        is an admirable quality. You are the kind kinda person! 
        I love you more than all the tastebuds on our tongues (even the ones that
        you can feel scrape off sometimes hehe).
        </br></br> Yours Truly,</br> The tinkiest of them all.</p>
