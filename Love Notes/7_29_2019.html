        <p>Dear Bubbs,</br></br>
          I promised you that I would write you at least one love letter per week, so
          here I am staying true to this promise EVEN on vacation haha. You are semi-asleep
          on the bed right now and your butt looks scrumptious HAHAHA. Anyway, this is going to be
          a very short love letter because I'm pretty sure you will wake up at any moment now screaming,
          "I CAN HANGGGG." You are the cutest. Hmmmm how about a quote??? Leo Christopher said,
          “I swear I couldn’t love you more than I do right now, and yet I know I will tomorrow.“
          This quote embodies the fun I'm having with you on our vacation right now. I am having
          so much fun, and yet, I am only going to love you more tomorrow and have even more fun hehe :)


        </br></br> Love,</br> Other Bubbs.</p>
