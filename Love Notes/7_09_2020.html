        <p>Dear, Hurricane Faye<br><br>

          Wow. To think that 364 days ago I decided to write you love letters on my website. I am so happy that I
          chose to do that because it was a way that I could truly show you how much I notice and appreciate all
          that you do for me. You are always sending me the sweetest texts and letters, calling me to see how I'm doing, buying
          little gifts for me, and preparing for our future together. This really was the least I could do for you.
          These 52 love letters have been great, but I plan on doing so much more for you. I am going to give you
          the best life you could ever have because I love you and I know that is exactly what you are going to
          give me. It is going to be effortless to be selfless and loving with you. You deserve all the love and
          attention in the world, and I plan on giving it you, Julia. This love letter isn't going to have a love
          quote because I want the main message of this love letter to be the fact that we are going to give each other
          so much love and so many gifts, and we are going appreciate and notice every single thing we do for each other.
          This past year of love letters went by quick, and I enjoyed every single moment of time that we got to spend
          together. We have so many more memories to make, and we have the best lives to look forward to. I love you, Julia.
          Here's to 52+ years of marriage together :) Living together is going to be such a fucking treat :))))



        <p>Love, Successful Boy</p>
