        <p>Dear Julia,</br></br> This marks three days
        in a row of my lava getting some love letters from her tinky
        boy! I want the love letters to be more of a treat, so
        from this point on, you will start receiving them once or
        twice a week (we had already talked about this haha). I had
        a lot of great fun last night with you on our date night. I think
        the "20 Questions" drinking game is my favorite drinking game
        to play. I have so much fun asking cute questions to you
        and answering yours. The dirty questions were a lot of
        fun, as well hehe. I love you for so many reasons, Julia.
        You are way more than a pretty face, and you are way more
        than a sexy body (but I really enjoy those things about you).
        John Donne said, “Love built on beauty, soon as beauty, dies.”
        I love you for your intelligence. I love you for the way you
        not only tell me how much you care about people and animals, but
        for the way you let your actions speak for themselves.
        I love you for your hilarious humor that is oddly close to my own.
        The way you show me how much you love me makes me want to love you
        way harder than I already do. I love you for all your little selfless acts
        you do for me. You are always cleaning up after me, making me food, and trying
        to spoil me with gifts even though you are a poor college girl. I am so
        optimistic about the future I will share with you, lava. I cannot wait for a
        life filled with loving each other.
        </br></br> Lots of hugs and kisses,</br> your tinky lava.</p>
