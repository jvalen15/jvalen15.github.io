        <p>Dear, Spot<br><br>

          After I missed deadlines in the past, you are very deserving of some love right about now! I know you haven't
          been feeling the best physically and mentally as of late, so I hope that this little piece of love can
          cheer you up. love! 15-love, LOVE! Hehe, we NEED to play tennis soon! Tennis can definitely be a quarantine
          activity! That will be fun on your birthday, my love :) I always get happy whenever you say things like,
          "Jordannn, I want you to put a baby in meeeee." Because even though you are being facetious in the moment, we
          both cannot wait to be married and to have kids together. I would want nothing more in life than to for us to
          both be able to skip school, find a cute place in a cute town, and to start our family together. Hitting
          the fast-forward button to when we live together would be so nice :) BUT we will have to just enjoy the
          time we have now until then :))) Time for a love quote, love.

          <br><br>
          "When we are in love we seem to ourselves quite different from what we were before." - Blaise Pascal
          <br><br>

          We were such different people than what we are now before we knew each other...well...maybe not that different.
          I mean, I have always been obsessed with melee, LSU, and burritos, and you have always loved music, volleyball,
          and old people, but we really have grown so much together AND grown so mature together! I also think this
          quote could be written a different way, "When we are in love we seem to ourselves quite different from everyone else."
          HAHA I bet people must think we are the absolute weirdest people sometimes, and I wouldn't have it any other freaking way.
          I love you so much, love. I cannot wait to be weird with you for the rest of our lives :)

        <p>Love, Arlo</p>
