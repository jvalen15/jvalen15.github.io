        <p>Dear Julia,</br></br> I am always finding ways to make things digital as a means
          of not being wasteful, so here are my digital love notes to you. I know
          having tangible love notes is special, and I will still write those in the
          future, but now you will never lose these love notes! You write me so many amazing
          love notes; they really brighten my mood and make me a much more sprightly person.
          Hopefully these can do the same to you! I know you have been feeling sad and nervous much more
          frequently recently, so I want reassure you that I am more in love with you than ever,
          and that there is nothing that you do or can do that will make me less in love with you
          (besides the obvious no-nos haha). I am in it to win it. I am riding for the long haul.
          I am bent on you. I will pay any price to be with you. I am all that jazz and more.
          I am your Valentine for life, and soon enough, you will be my Valentine for life, as well.
          I BET THAT ONE MADE YOUR FACE RED (MUAHAHA). Anyway, I just love you so so so much. This is love
          note number 1 out of many more to come. I hope you slept well and are well rested for a phenomenal
          night at work.</br></br> With much love,</br> your lava.</p>
