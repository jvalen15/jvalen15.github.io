        <p>Dear Lovey Dovey Bubby,</br></br>
          It has been one week since my last love letter to you! So I am not late;
          technically, I am right on time! I have been having the time of the life on this
          trip with you. Every single place I have went with you has been so magical!
          I am writing this right before we are arriving at the "Please Touch Museum" You are doing an
          excellent job of driving while I am on my computer haha. I told you I was working on my resume,
          but I am a dirty little liar :). Anyway, I just wanted you to know that this trip has done
          nothing but solidify my feelings for you and my feelings for what I want with you in
          the future. I will love you forever and always :)


        </br></br> Love,</br> Your Alien.</p>
