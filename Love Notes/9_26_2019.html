        <p>Dear, Booby Girl<br><br>
          WOWZA. You are indeed overdue for a love letter from your lava. I just wanted to say that I have had
          the most fun with you these past 11 months (Hehe, we matched on Tinder 11 months ago, today)! I love our drunk nights,
          and I love our fun times so much. I had the best time ever in the Keys with you. I'm so glad you like my dad who
          is a lot like me and not like me at all haha. I'm sorry he thinks you're attractive hahahaha. I hope you are sleeping pleasantly
          right now. I wish i could just cuddle the heck outta you right now. Liam said Sarah will come over Saturday night! Liam said we can
          do drinking games and Jackbox Party games. It will be so much fun. I'm glad you are getting to enjoy the time with your dad this week. I bet that
          this was very fun and refreshing. I think I might just work on our videos today haha. I have been slacking off! Hmmmmm, Do you hear that?
          IT'S THE SOUND OF THE LOVE QUOTE TRAIN! CHOO CHOO!

          Sometimes Ed Just really hits the spot, ya know? Haha yeah, you know. She knows guys, it's okay. My gf knows allllll
          about it. She's a Smarty McFarty. I can't wait to make you Mrs. Valentine one day MUAHAHAHA.

        <br><br>Love,<br>Your Booby Boy</p>
