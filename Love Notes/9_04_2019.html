        <p>Dear hedgehog,<br><br>
          You are so overdue for a love letter! How have you made it this long without one????
          I'm so very sorry that I break some of our pinky promises, Julia. That is totally not cool to do
          because it does give less power to the pinky promise! I will be so much better about our promises
          in the future :) I promise to still try to give you a love letter every week, but sometimes I am
          very tinky (as you know), so I might miss the deadline every now and then! I absolutely cannot wait
          for you to visit me this weekend. We are going to be getting the best canoodling done. An
          unprecedented amount of canoodling will be canoodled. I love thinking about the future with you, Julia.
          Whether it be looking forward to a weekend with you or a life with you, I just get so ecstatic either
          way :))) Remember, we are still in the preface of our story together hehe. We haven't even started
          Chapter 1!!! I love you more than Hinata loves volleyball!!! Ooh ooh! We should play some volleyball
          this weekend! Okay fineeee, I'll get back to class now! I hope this week continues to go fast for us!
          I can't wait for tomorrow! We're going to have the best time ever :)
