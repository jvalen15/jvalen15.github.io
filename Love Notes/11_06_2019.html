        <p>Dear, Bouncy Boobies <br><br>

          Your boobies are just so bouncyyyyy. I absolutely loved that picture that you sent me. You know the one.
          The one where you jumped and your boobies were bouncing in mid-air? Ahhhh, that's the stuff. In one of the jumpy ones you sent,
          it looks like you have boy boobies hahaha. I miss you, love. It stinks that I won't be able to see you for another week, but man oh man will it
          be great to travel with you and spend time at the beach with you. We will be kickin' back, relaxin' and chillin'. I'll make sure to
          let you have the AUX cord for at least 80% of the time. OOH. Maybe we can listen to a true crime podcast! I've been missing those.
          Psyduck has enjoyed his time at Dad's. He just keeps looking at me while I type out this love letter. Maybe I'll turn him around until
          I'm done. But he's just so dern cute. I might never give him back to his mother. Muahaha. He's mine forever. You know who else is mine
          forever? Yup, you guessed it. The future Julia Valentine. I just love her so much. You give my life so much meaning. I'm serious, love.
          My life changed for the better in so many ways because of your loving ass. Oooooh, how about a love quote on how you give my life so much meaning?

          Ahhhh, that's a good one. I'm just so passionate about you and about us, bubby. it's going to be you and me Vs. the world. Bowser and Kirby Vs.
          every other character. We are going to beat some teeny weenies up, my love. I can't wait to see you soon, and I seriously can't wait to
          golf with you again. Maybe it will become our thing one day :)

        <p>Love, Hairy Weeny</p>
