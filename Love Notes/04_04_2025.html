        <p>Dear Birthday Bunny,<br><br>

          Another year goes by for my true soulmate. I know you don't like getting older, but I do like growing older with you.

          As time passes between us, I realize more and more that we are meant to be together. I could not ever see myself being with any other person.

          It's funny because we started saying, “you just get it” to each other very early on, but I always go back to it. I just love being on the same wavelength as you.

          I hate that you've been sick and anxious recently and it makes me so sad how much it has messed with you. I really hope you are all okay today.

          Maybe we'll go out tonight? I don't know if we will, but we will absolutely look for a desk for you tomorrow. I can't wait to have a fun Saturday with you.

          <br><br>"You are my today and all of my tomorrows." - Leo Christopher <br><br>

          As time goes on, we will be each other's constants. As things change in our lives, we will be each other's constants. Through our ups and downs, we will be each other's constants.

          There are things in life that we cannot change. We cannot change the passage of time. We cannot change our past, but we can live in the moment with each other and make the most out of every moment we have together.

          I love you so much honey. Happy birthday!!!

        <p>Love, HubbaBubba</p>
