        <p>Dear, Tink<br><br>


          I am starting to write this letter on March 23rd, but I have a feeling you won't get it until the 24th, and you may not
          even read it until the 25th! I have been enjoying the absolute heckle out of our quarantine dates together. They have
          been so freaking fun, and I wouldn't trade spending time with you for anything else in the world. I hope you liked your
          clean apartment and dinner that I prepared on Monday night :) I love doing things for you. You are my muse. You have
          given me more inspiration to create than anything has ever given me. I have built palaces out of paragraphs for you.
          I have made you video games that showcase our love, and I have put together YouTube videos that show the amazing times we
          have had together. But let us not forget about you, Julia. You have built me castles out of loving words, you have
          made me meals that I will remember forever, and you have also used you creative ingenuity to make me amazing videos.
          I love you, and I love us.

          The Raven dude could not have said it any better. You bring out the artisticness in me. You make me the creative boy
          that you know and love. Not only that, but YOU make me a good boyfriend. YOU make me a loving guy. YOU make me kind.
          Without you, I would not be half the guy that I am. Our love is unique and powerful. I love us so much. I think
          you should give yourself a lot of credit for how powerful our love is :) Hehe You are the best girlfriend ever. I can't
          wait to last this pandemic out with you. Movie dates until the day we die. *Heart* *Heart* *Kiss* *Kiss*

        <p>Love, Tonk </p>
