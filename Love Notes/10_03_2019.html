        <p>Dear, <a href="#" onclick="document.getElementById('player').play()">Tinky Bubby</a> (Click Me)<br><br>
          YAYYY I get to spend my birthday weekend with the woman I love :). Thank you so much for
          the flowers last weekend. That was so sweet and thoughtful of you. My professor today literally said,
          "Your girlfriend sounds like she has such a big heart." when we were talking about you. HAHAHA
          I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE GAVE ME HER NUMBER TO GIVE TO YOU WHAT THE HECK. She hasn't even met you, and yet, she
          wants to be friends with you. I truly have the coolest bubby out of ALL DA BUBBIES. Uh-huhhhh das my bubby.
          I'm just so proud and thankful for you bubby, and these love letters are my way of letting you know how much
          I notice and appreciate every little thing you do for me and every little thing you do for us. As I am writing
          this, you are probably still sleeping sound in that super comfy bed of yours. Man, do I miss jumping on you while
          you're lying down in bed. I called my mom today and said I had something serious to talk to her about and she
          thought I was going to say that you were pregnant hahahaha. I thought you would enjoy that. There has just been
          too much talk of you getting pregnant recently hehe. Well, one day it would be cool for us to have a kid together.
          One day, we might just do that, but, I look forward to all the time we get alone before that :) We have an incredible
          future in store for the two of us together. I'm so lucky I got to meet you, and I am so lucky to be able to call you, "mine."
        <br><br>Love,<br><a href="#" onclick="document.getElementById('player').play()">Tinky Bubby</a> (Click Me)</p>
