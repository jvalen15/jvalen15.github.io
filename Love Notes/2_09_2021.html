        <p>Dear Tinky Tunky Blinkers,<br><br>

          You are god damn right it is time for you to get a love letter!!! It has been far too long since your last love letter. You were way overdue and you have been such a good bubby that you definitely deserve this love letter!
          I have been absolutely so ecstatic to be back in OUR home. You are the one person who TRULY gets me. You are the person who cares for me everyday. You are the person who puts me first no matter what. And what's even better than all of those things is
          that you are MY person. I could not be happier with you, Julia. I really don't thank you enough or tell you how much I love you enough, So I'm really glad I could give you this love letter. I cannot wait for you to get back from work. I love you, baby :)

        <p>Love, Your best friend and your LOML</p>
