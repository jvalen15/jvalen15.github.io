        <p>Dear Julia,</br></br> It is not a guarantee that you will get a
        love letter everyday, but I decided I would write you one that you might read while we are drunk
        tonight. You are always apologizing for not being good enough in whatever
        area. You apologize for your attitudes, your looks, and your patience. Your looks
        never wafer (hehe). You are seriously the hottest, sexiest, most beautiful human
        I have ever laid my eyes on and laid in bed with HAHA. Your patience and attitudes
        can waver sometimes, though (You are an emotional gal, ENNEAGRAM 4) You say
        your weird moods are going to cause me to love you less, but oh boy do I have
        a quote for you! (You are my little quote hoe hehe). “You come to love not by finding the
        perfect person, but by seeing an imperfect person perfectly.” I am not perfect.
        You are not perfect, but you are perfect TO ME. You can still do no wrong in my
        eyes. I have you on the highest pedestal, my lava. I love you oh so much, and
        I will continue to love you so much for the rest of our days. I cannot wait for
        our date tonight! It will be magical :) </br></br> With much love,</br> your lava.</p>
