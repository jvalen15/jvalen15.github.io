        <p>Dear Working Lady,<br><br>

          I'm happy I still know how to write these things after how long it's been since my last love letter. Six whole months!! Wow, a lot has changed since then.

          Bubba, first of all, I'd like to tell you just how proud I am of you and how happy I am that you are my stinking (stinky?) wife. I could not have lucked out any more in the wife lottery fr fr.

          You have been doing such an amazing job at work, and it is really inspiring to me. I just want to be the best husband I can because of you. I am so excited for our wedding celebration in two months.

          We are going to throw such a kick-ass party!! Well, here's a love quote:



          <br><br>"Let the beauty of what you love be what you do." - Rumi <br><br>

          This is so true in your line of work, and in our relationship. You are the beauty of what I love, so I do you! MUAHAHA.

          I just love you so much, bubba.


        <p>Love, SAHH</p>
