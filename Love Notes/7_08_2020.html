        <p>Dear, Tuscan Sun<br><br>

          Hello, my love. I hope you enjoy your second to last love letter of the year! I always have so much fun texting you, and I still get so giddy at your messages. You
          are seriously the funniest person I have ever known. It is the most mind blowing thing to me that I found you. I know you are always freaking out about what there is
          after life, or if one of us were to die young, but I freak out in a good way that I got to be the luckiest guy in the world by choosing you to be my life partner. I think you will
          realize just how lucky we are and it will calm your anxiety about life over time. I promise you that we will grow old together. We have our whole lives to look forward to together.
          Let's rejoice in the possibilities, rather than worry about them. You are my Ellie *BIG HEART*

          "More than kisses, letters mingle souls." - John Donne
          <br><br>

          I like this quote and holy crap is it a fitting love quote for a love letter, but I say that kisses AND letters mingle souls equally.
          We will forever do such a good job of mingling our souls, Julia. I know we always talk about how it is healthy for us to not be dependant on each other, but
          I think I will always depend on you and vice versa. It is hard to go on with life when you are missing half of yourself, and YOU are half of myself. I cannot wait to be
          forever untied with my other half and create other beings with my other half. I love you, Julia :)

        <p>Love, Couch boy</p>
