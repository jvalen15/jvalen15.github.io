        <p>Dear Juliaaaaa,</br></br>
          I am in the car with Jonathan on our way to pick up our dear friends,
          Megan and Mikolai (hehe). I just wanted to tell you that I had the most amazing
          vacation ever with you. I am really looking forward to so many more with you. I also
          wanted to tell you that I miss you so so so much. "Every thing is so much better when
          I get to experience it with you by my side" - Me, I said that hehe. I said it in the past,
          and I'll say it again, you are my other half. I love thinking of sex as us coming together as
          one entity :) It will always be so loving between us. I know you said that you would write
          me love letters while I was in Florida, but I just couldn't resist writing you some more. I
          just love you so much *emoji with hearts around it*. I also just thought of something else
          that could make us come together as one person, too. It's totally not marriage hahaha.
          I can't wait to have married sex with you for the first time ever. It's going to be rad.
        </br></br> I Love you,</br> Your Jor Podia.</p>
