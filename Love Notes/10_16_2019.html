        <p>Dear, Angel <br><br>

          I know you are sleeping right now (like a little angel), but I just had to give you something sweet to
          wake up to. I am covertly writing this love letter while I am in my Animal Ethics class! Hehe. I actually
          started this love letter yesterday, but then I got tired and passed out at like 8 P.M. (I am such a copycat)!
          I like that I can write these love letters as a little way of showing you how much I love and care about you.
          Sometimes I enter deep-thought thinking about in what ways you might be successful in life - The possibilities are
          endless - and I like imagining you as an NPR reporter, a newspaper journalist, or a podcast/radio show host. I just
          think you are going to be so successful in life, my love. I'm going to be right by your side through it all!

          <br><br>
          "I look at you and see the rest of my life in front of my eyes."
          <br><br>

          We just have so much in store for us, Julia. I cannot wait to travel the entire world with you. Maybe one day we
          won't even be living in America. What if we settled down in Ireland or something? I think that would just be so cool. Well,
          anyway honey, I just love you so stinking much, and I hope you enjoy the heckle out of this love letter. I'll be yours forever.

        <p>Love, Your Boy (I'm yoursssss)!</p>
