        <p>Dear, uh-huhhh das my Bubby<br><br>
          I bet you're going to open this while we're at the airport or something. Anyway, hiiiiii
          bubbbbbyyyyyy. YOU ARE DUE FOR A WUV WETTER! I bet you liked the picture of me sleeping (I thought
          it was a very flattering photo). I love you and I miss you and excuse me and I love you. EEEP,
          I get to see you tomorrow ahhhhh! I am going to go so ham on your butt cheeks tomorrow oh my lord. I am
          also going to give you one million kisses tomorrow :). I just miss you so much lovey. I'm sorry we are
          going to be in Florida just as you were starting to get excited for fall weather! I promise we won't have to live
          there when we are older haha. WE CAN LIVE ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE....'cept floda. Hmmm *sniff* *sniff* I smell pussy
          JUST KIDDING, I smell a love quote! <br><br> "You donâ€™t love someone for their looks, or their clothes,
          or for their fancy car, but because they sing a song only you can hear." - Oscar Wilde <br><br>
          This is another quote that makes me think about how weird we are, AND how much I love how weird we are :)
          We are going to have the best weekend ever eeeeep. I cannot wait for tomorrow.

        <br><br>Love,<br>uh-huhhh I'm yo Bubby</p>
