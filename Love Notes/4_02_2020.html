        <p>Dear, Birthday Girl<br><br>

          AHHHH You're going to be 21!!!! I am so fucking excited to be able to spend your 21st birthday with you :) We
          are going to drink, party, and have a blast! This quarantine can't stop these two bunnies from having a fucking
          good time :) I can't wait for our birthday dinner! We are about to look so flipping snazzy. Now spillers, you better
          not spill wine on my nice suit. I'm warning you. If you do, then birthday girl is sure to get a punishment! Hehe
          I was really happy to be able to get out of the Charlotte house and go to my getaway vacation studio apartment by the
          beach with my bubby. It is a mess in that house! And those guys literally want to get fucked everyday! My saving grace
          was working out in the garage! It was very therapeutic :) I also enjoyed making your game :) IT'S TIME FOR A BIRTHDAY LOVE QUOTE!

          "Do not grow old, no matter how long you live. Never cease to stand like curious children before the Great Mystery into which we were born." - Albert Einstein
          <br><br>

          I think people like to credit Albert Einstein with lots of quotes that he might not have said. I hope he said this one because
          I really like that dude. He was cool and wore women's shoes. You can go from 20 to 21, but you can always have your cute, childish
          nature. I can't wait to grow old with you, but I never want us to change from our weird, curious ways. I don't think
          that we will ever change those ways. BUTTHOLE TOUCHES FOREVER WOOHOO!!!! Hehe I hope that you don't read this until your
          birthday, but if you choose to read it earlier, then I would love that, too. I love you, birthday bunny. I cannot wait to
          spend every birthday with you for the rest of your life. We will never lose our youthfulness :)

        <p>Love, 22 and a half boy</p>
