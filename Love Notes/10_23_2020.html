        <p>Dear HLJ,<br><br>

          It seems that my love letters have left the weekly basis and entered the monthly basis. Oh well, now you
          will enjoy them even more because of how rare they are to get!!! This love letter also has very significant
          meaning as October 26th, 2018 was the first time we interacted with each other, and November 1st, 2018 is our
          anniversary of dating. Little did we know that we would be with each other for the rest of our lives when we
          first started talking to each other, but here we are, happy and so in love. This love letter is not our 2 year anniversary letter,
          but it is part of your present. This love letter will serve as something to get you excited for the presents that
          you will receive on November 1st. Some day in the near future I will propose to you, and we will be two nut pods engaged. I will
          wake up every morning and look at you and say, "That thing right there is my Fiance." You are my woman. You are my soul mate.
          I am your man, and I am your soul mate. I have never been so fulfilled and happy in my entire life. I love you so much, Julia. I can't
          wait for November 1st and all the days to come. *BIG KISSES*

        <p>Love, Also HLJ</p>
