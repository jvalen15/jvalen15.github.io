        <p>Dear Secretary Valentine,<br><br>

          Congratulations on a productive morning and resisting the temptation of morning gummies! I know that must've felt rewarding :) Oh, of course, yes, you must
          be wondering..."What the heckle??? A random love letter??? What is this???" And to that I say...Surprise!! It's definitely not everyday that you receive a love
          letter, but I truly believe that love letters are good for both of our healths. Love letters are a great way for me to express to you my love, gratitude, and overall positive thoughts
          about you because I am pretty reserved and won't always tell you the positive thoughts that I have about you! I know you love to hear praise and love from me so, yes, love letters are just good for the both of us :)
          I'm a writer not a lover. Just kidding, I'm both, but I thought that play on words was funny for this situation. Wow. We are really going to do the damn deed in exactly a week. This is such a huge step in our relationship, and I could not be more ready.
          I've been feeling pretty burnt out in life because of work recently, but our upcoming wedding has really given me a big second wind. I am so ready to be your husband :)

          "I have for the first time found what I can truly love. I have found you." â€” Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre

          I wanted to find a quote that was more suitable for weddings, but I found this one and had to use it. It's Jane freakin Eyre. I just knew you
          would love it. The phrase "True Love" really meant something when I finally had you. For I have never truly loved anything like I love you, Julia :)

        <p>Love, Bubba</p>
