        <p>Dear, Shrimp on da bobby<br><br>

          Writing about philosophy is hard, but writing a love letter to my bobby is the easiest and most lovely thing in the
          world to do. This is the 40th love letter that I have written you on this gosh dern website and this is cheers to
          4,000 more! I am having the best spring break of my life, and no matter how many times you apologize for being busy
          with other priorities, I will still say that this is exactly how I wanted to spend my spring break :) I saw Dakotah pass
          by on his bike earlier, and it looked like he was headed to his same old apartment, so at least he is not homeless haha.
          I applied for a summer internship job in Wilmington, and even though I didn't quite have the qualifications it was looking
          for, the idea of living with you for a summer is absolutley lovely. *kiss*  *kiss*  *kiss*  *kiss*  *kiss*  *kiss*
          I'm sorry I didn't get you a really real Valentine's Day present, but I hope you can enjoy a love letter, a fun drinking
          game, a nice dinner, and playing last year's video game for old time's sake :) I am still so in love with you babe. My
          love is on an endless climb with you. It knows no bounds.

          <br><br>

          Normal love quotes just don't do it for me anymore. I have graduated to only using love quotes about a mature type of
          relationship: marriage. It is going to be so cool to be able to call you my Fiance for a while, and then call you
          my frickin wife. WHY DON'T I WAIT ON MY WIFE. Hehe. You were thinking it, too. Don't lie muahaha. Anyway, I feel like
          you might as well have coined this quote because it sounds like it came straight from your beautifully crafted mouth. I
          also want to be very married. We have talked about this before, but we are not going to settle when we become married.
          Marriage is like a brand new beginning, or as I like to call it: Chapter One. We are still in the introduction to our
          wonderful life together. Happy Valentine's Day in March, my love. hahaha :)

        <p>Love, your pooper </p>
