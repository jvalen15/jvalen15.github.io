        <p>Dear Julia Valentine,<br><br>

          Julia, do you want to know what you are to me? You are my best friend, my lover for life, my right hand, my caretaker, my number one source of humor, my go to show buddy, my eternal roommate, my chef,
          and much much more. I can't thank you enough for all that you do and have done for me, Julia. Valentine's Day is a nice excuse for me to remind you of just how much I love you, and how grateful I am to have
          someone who loves me as much as you love me. I could not imagine a life where you are not by my side. That would be the saddest, loneliest life ever. I really do need you, baby. I will always need you. We
          are a package. We are the Valentines :) As part of my Valentine's Day gift yo you, I hereby give you an I.O.U to take me to Cape Fear Games and pick out whatever Disc you want! That can be your special disc whenever we go disc golfing, and it can be the start of your collection!
          I love you so so so much, Julia, and I am looking forward to a very special day with you :)
          
        <p>Love, Jordan Valentine</p>
