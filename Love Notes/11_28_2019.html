        <p>Dear, Ellie <br><br>

          Gobble, gobble, "Adventure is out there." I honestly think that will be a good motto for us moving forward. The more I think about
          it, my mom was dead right. You really get me out of house and doing so many new, different things. You were the
          best possible thing that could ever happen to me. I am so so so so so thankful for you, my love. I can't wait
          to travel to Paradise Falls with you when we get older. We are going to park our house right up on that waterfall
          and enjoy the view. Life really hasn't been about the destination with you. The destination will be really cool,
          like urging, merging, and having kergings. The journey is what has been and will continue to be so much fun with
          you. I really am just having the most amazing time on this ride with you. You are so good to me and so good for me.
          Maybe there was a good reason for me to do my love letter a day late hehe because I am just so gosh dang thankful
          for you. My life would not be the same at all without you. You have made me such a better person. You have made me
          the man I am right now :) Now I gotta get a good quote for my quote hoe.

          <br><br>
          "No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks." - James Allen
          <br><br>

          This sums it up quite well. I don't tell you enough how thankful I am for you, and how much you mean to me. I am so
          grateful your six foot two ass slid its way into my life. I will always be here for you for morning cuddles, for catching
          you whenever you jump on me, for reassuring you of my love to you, and for just loving you in general. I am your forever boy, and
          I am just so thankful for my forever girl. Julia Hood, you are mine.

        <p>Love, Carl</p>
