        <p>Dear, Honey<br><br>

          "He just writes and he writes." Ahhh to be Hamilton. I dream of a job where I can just write to my heart's content for a living. I
          would write you a love letter every single day if that were the case. I would definitely build you palaces out of paragraphs... some
          big ole cathedrals would be crafted. Eeeeeeep, I can't wait for all of our little mini vaycays coming up. We got a wedding in Savannah, we got
          a family trip in Beaufort, and we have a hot spring break trip in Florida. Wow, it is going to be so much fun (as it always is with you).
          There is honestly no person I would rather hang out with than you. If I had to be trapped in an elevator with anyone for 24 hours, then I
          wouldn't even pick a famous person, I would just pick you :) Screw Steph Curry and Joe Burrow, I don't need 'em. Hehe I just love you so
          dern freaking much my sweet potato fries. We are a couple of nut pos in love for forever and ever and ever and ever and...oh what's that?
          Time for a love letter??? Hmmm, okay! OOH Also thank you so much for your video you made me, it was incredible!!! ILYSM!!!!!

          I like this whole new theme I have about love quotes that have something to do with marriage. Hmmmm, it couldn't be a sign, could it?
          Muahahaha, one day soon I will make you my forever girl (as if I already haven't). No one can challenge our love, no one can challenge
          our dynamic, and most importantly, no one can challenge our tinky, weird, perfect friendship. We kind of were meant to be together. We
          are just a couple of free willing compatibilists who fell in love with each other's minds and bodies. Happy Early Valentine's Day my
          sweet Julia. I bet you would be happier to be a Valentine on Valentine's Day ;)

        <p>Love, Bob</p>
