        <p>Dear Julia,</br></br> It is a day like today that you really need
        a love letter from your bubby. I'm sorry that the past couple of days have
        been weird for us. I know that you have felt very guilty about recent events
        and that you have felt oh so nervous about us. Julia, I want to reassure you that you
        are the one for me, and that I am the one for you. Little things that happen to us
        will not drive our love away. I don't want you to worry about us. I want you to know that
        our relationship is the last thing you should worry about. I say this because I am fully
        committed to being with you for the rest of my days. I know you truly care about me, Julia. I
        truly care about you, too. On a more humerous note, think about how lucky I am to be dating
        a bisexual girl. YOU COULD LITERALLY DATE GIRLS WHO ARE CUTER, NICER, AND DON'T FREAKING SMELL. Yet,
        you chose to have me as your bubby :') (and that means the world to me). Thank you for loving me, Julia.
        I assure you that we are meant to be together. I don't see a future for me that doesn't include you.
      </br></br> With all the love I have,</br> your forever boy.</p>
