        <p>Dear Bobble of my eye,<br><br>

          During my last love letter I mentioned how you were going through such a hard time in your life.

          I had also mentioned that you were being rude/mean to me at times.

          It's funny how far we have come since our lowest points. I could not be more grateful for you, and I am so happy to call you my wife.

          We need to spend more meaningful time together, but I just think the world of you, and I'm so very proud of you and us.

          You are my best friend and you continue to give me inspiration. I love to code. I love to make projects. I love to write.

          I would not have redownloaded my programming applications last night if it was not for you.

          You are still my muse, and I always need to remember that. It is time for a lovely love quote.

          <br><br>"I ask you to pass through life at my side—to be my second self, and best earthly companion." - Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre <br><br>

          Jarvy actually helped me find that one. I can never get another you, and I task us to cherish each other.

          We need to hold each other close. We need to take in our mornings together and really appreciate the love that we have. 

          We need to remember to be romantic and to kiss each other like each kiss could be our last.

          I am still so in love with you, Julia. I need to never take what we have for granted. I can't wait to see you again.

          Who knows. I might even have a physical surprise for you when you get home.

        <p>Love, Boobeyes</p>
