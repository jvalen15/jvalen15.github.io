        <p>Dear Alligator Girlie,<br><br>

          I think by this point, you can expect a new love letter on the website once every four months :( I really would like to get in a habit of writing you more love letters,
          so I need to somehow become unburnt-out from work. I absolutely love writing you love letters; it's funny how our brains can sometimes keep ourselves from doing the things we adore.
          Anyway bubby, I just know how much you've been looking forward to one of these, and I just wanted to let you know just how much I love, appreciate, and adore you.
          I am sooo sooo excited to be marrying you in less than a month!! AHHHHH!! So exciting! I am also so happy to be taking care of the things that we need to get done. It makes everything feel even more real and exciting!
          You will soon be Mrs. Valentine, my wife :)))) Going to Holden Beach with you is going to be so refreshing and fun! It's always nice to have a getaway vacation with my lava. We are going to play so many games!! It's also not
          a Holden Beach trip unless we get mimosas. Muahahaha. Actually we must drink mimosas and play poker! That's gotta be our Holden Beach tradition. You know what time it is, babe? It's time for a love quote!

          "To be your friend was all I ever wanted; to be your lover was all I ever dreamed." - Valerie Lombardo

          We always talk about how amazing it is to be best friends who are in love. It is so nice to be best friends, but it really is a dream to be your lover. We are lovers first :) I love you so much, Julia.

        <p>Love, Gurtle</p>
