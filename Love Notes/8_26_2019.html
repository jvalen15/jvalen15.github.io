        <p>Dear Booger Girl,<br><br>
          I not the booger eater, you are! I have really enjoyed reading Animal Liberation by
          Peter Singer. It is so cool to read something that solidifies my beliefs in veganism, gives
          me evidence to support my beliefs, and captures my attention with even more great perspectives
          to consider. It feels like a cheat code that this course will help me with my degree! Animal
          Ethics will be a close second in my favorite courses at UNCC (The Anime movie class is #1). I
          really enjoyed your visit this past weekend. We got some intense canoodling done. We really started off
          on a really good note and ended the weekend on a really good note. We had one bump in the middle
          of the visit, but we have a more solid foundation of a relationship thanks to the bump. We will both
          continue to get better at not getting weird.
           <br><br> TIME FOR A QUOTE:<br><br>“Love won’t be tampered with,
           love won’t go away. Push it to one side and it creeps
           to the other.” - Louise Erdrich <br><br>
           Even though we get weird at each other sometimes, we still always work things out and find
           ourselves just as if not more in love with each other. There is also that Bible verse about
           love that explains our relationship well. "Love is patient, love is kind...." YOU KNOW THE ONE
           HAHA YEAH YOU DO. Anyway bubby, I wrote this love letter in class, and now I have to get back to
           paying attention hehe. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, JULIA. YOU ARE THE BEST THING TO EVER HAPPEN TO ME.


        <br><br>Love,<br>Your Booger Boy</p>
