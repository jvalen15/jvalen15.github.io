        <p>Dear, Tinky Bunz <br><br>

          You definitely go to a big, real university bubby :) 90 students in one class??? You're in the big leagues now hehe.
          I know the love letter isn't due until tomorrow, my love, but I just couldn't wait another day to write you my words
          of love in the form of a letter. I had such an incredible weekend with you, Julia. You would think with how busy
          and hardworking we all were that it wouldn't have been that fun, but man oh man did we have manage to have a bwast!
          I really like your school, honey. I think you are really going to come to find Wilmington as your home :) It doesn't
          hurt to have a restaurant as amazing as Indochine in the place that you live, also ;) I think Megamind is now in my
          top 5 movies. That will be helpful if I can ever remember the other 4! Every weekend with you is so magical... Every
          day with you is so magical... I will cherish every hour, minute, and second that I get to spend with the love of my
          freaking life :))) What's that smell? *sniff* *sniff* I smell a love quote :)

          Ahhhh, this one really reminded me of you. You definitely find yourself missing me before I'm even gone yet, and tbh,
          I find myself missing you before I have even left, too. We just always manage to have such a good time when we are
          together, and I am looking forward so much to seeing you this weekend :))) I am going to clean the fuck out of the
          house in anticipation for your arrival!! It's going to be fucking spotless, my love :) I love you so much, Julia. You
          are my one and only until the end of time.

        <p>Love, Bubby with a side of tink</p>
