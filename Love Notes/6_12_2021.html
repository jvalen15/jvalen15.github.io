        <p>Dear Julia Schmulia,<br><br>

          CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT IT HAS BEEN 4 MONTHS SINCE I LAST WROTE YOU A LOVE LETTER?!?! It's about god dang time you got one, baby. If four months went by this fast, then we will literally be married in no
          time at all :) It's going to be a dream come true being married to my best friend and the love of my flippin life. I cannot wait to see you, and be with you tomorrow. It feels like it has been forever since
          I've seen my love. Right now, it is raining outside in Wilmington, and you would absolutely be enjoying it so much if you were here. I made the other box of Daiya Mac and Cheese, and I have to say that I do like
          the Cheddar and Bacon Bits one better, honey. I know, I know, it is definitely not often that we disagree on such important subjects. Well, it's about time for a love quote, huh.

          "If I had a flower for every time I thought of you, then I could walk in my garden forever" - JorPod

          I really am just always thinking of you (especially when I haven't seen you in so long). And I know how much we want a garden one day, so this is such a good and cute love quote for us :)

          I cannot wait to have a fun indoors movie date with you tomorrow. We are gonna have so many kid cuddies you have no idea. :))))

        <p>Love, Jordan Schmordan</p>
