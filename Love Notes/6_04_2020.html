        <p>Dear, My Wonky & My Tonky<br><br>

          Woo! I just finished doing another hour and a half of homework! This time, I made sure to write you a love letter
          after finishing! I can't believe you are going to drive 5 hours and 30 minutes to come and see me tonight! You are
          truly the best girlfriend any guy could hope for. I hope this love letter is a good enough present for you hehe. Wow, I also cannot
          believe that you already bought me my birthday present! AHHHH! What the heck, bubbsy, you are the frickin greatest! I just
          want to let you know that I appreciate and notice and love all that you do for me, Julia. I really can't thank you enough. There
          are also things you do for me that you might not even know about! I have become a more driven person ever since we met, I have
          become a nicer person ever since we met, and I have even become a better cook as of late! I really do think you have
          been forming and molding me into the best version of myself, and that is the greatest gift I could ever ask for. I love you, Julia. I
          think it is time for a love quote.

          "I love that feeling of being in love, the effect of having butterflies when you wake up in the morning. That is special." - Jennifer Aniston
          <br><br>

          You just knew I was going to include a love quote from Jennifer Aniston one of these days. If I had to only use one word to describe our love,
          then I would be forced to use the word, "Special." I know our love is so special. Seeing each other is special. Waking up in the morning
          next to you is special. Trying new foods together is special. Showing each other our favorite things is special. Traveling is
          special. God, everything about our love is just so special, and I can never get enough of it. I will be so happy to go throughout life with
          you knowing that it is always going to be special. I love you, Julia. I can never get enough of you, perfect love. :)

        <p>Love, Your Bubby & Hubby (Not Tubby)</p>
