        <p>Dear, Lots of Hair Girl<br><br>

          Hello, Love :) How was work? I hope it was amazing. It couldn't have been worse than yesterday! I'm so glad you ended
          up getting a bonus pay rate. You really deserve it because your job is much harder and much more dangerous due to the
          pandemic. I am just so proud of you and so proud of your mindset, my love. You said, "I should be thankful that I still
          have a job during these hard times." I thought that you saying that was just so amazing. I love you so much. I have had such an
          an amazing week with you. It's bitter sweet to see it come to an end. I was so freaking happy that I got to spend your
          birthday with you, and I hope you had as much fun as I did hehe. Seeing your parents was also the most refreshing trip ever.
          I think once we got there, that our hangovers started to become cured by the lovely town of beaufort :) Love quote time:

          <br><br>
          "Absence sharpens love, presence strengthens it." - Thomas Fuller
          <br><br>

          Ahh what a relevant quote for us. This quote was just made for two love birds who are in a long distance relationship :)
          As you were talking about earlier, I, too, feel like this week has strengthened our love so much. And, before the sharpening
          process, I can't wait to have one more amazing night with you. It is going to be so much fun, and I can't wait to
          give you your surprises. Oh, I guess this is one of your surprises haha :) Anyway, I just love you so much my one and only.
          Let us continue to love each other both selfishly AND selflessly.

        <p>Love, Super Bald Boy</p>
