        <p>Dear, Baby Fever Girl<br><br>

          This love letter is going to be a bit shorter and it is going to have no love quote! OH NO, JORDAN, HOW
          COULD HE HAVE DONE THIS?? OH WHYYYY!!! Well this love letter is going to include my first comic of "The Life of Julia."
          DON'T CLICK THE BUTTON YET! I had a little burst of inspiration so I decided to write a cute little comic muahaha. Wow, what a wonderful weekend
          we had with my family. I got some great ideas for our wedding I did hehe. I can't believe you completely
          guessed the exact picture I would use for this love letter. How could I use any other picture??? We just look
          like the perfect parents!! We are seriously the cutest parents ever AND we haven't even had our own kid yet!
          I bet our kid will be the perfect kid. Seriously, they would be amazing. I can't wait for our future. It is
          going to be the best future ever with you :). Okay, now you may click the button! PUSH THE BUTTON!! Haha I crack myself
          up!

          <br><br>

          <img id="demo" src = "">

          <br><br>

          <button onclick="myFunction()">THIS IS THE BUTTON</button>

          <script>
          function myFunction() {
            document.getElementById("demo").src = "../img/TLOJ.JPG";
          }
          </script>
          <br><br>

          Muahahaha isn't that so us. Well, so you haha. It was the first idea I had that I could kind of
          easily draw. So, I went for it :) I hope you liked it my love. I cannot wait for you to be my +1 at future
          weddings and my beautiful bride at my wedding :) I love you to the moon and back and back to the moon and
          back to earth and...hehe you get the point :)))

        <p>Love, Jor Luv Juul</p>
