        <p>Dear, Chun Li<br><br>

          Ello, Love :) It has almost been one whole year since I started writing these love letters to you! Wow.
          Time really does fly when you are having fun. I have just had so much fun with you these past 19 months,
          my love. I also had loads of fun with you over this past week! Packing up Camp Stefanini was very sad, but
          I enjoyed the times I had with your family. Your family is truly the bomb.com! My hair is turning blonde as I write
          out this love letter, and it is going to be really funny whenever you get here hehe. Also, tonight is going
          to be a lot of fun with Emma and Dakotah. These nights are so freaking memorable.

          This love letter is short and sweet, but I hope you like it, Julia. I am so excited to move in with you soon, and
          I am even more excited to get to make you my wife soon. It is just so thrilling to do "homie" things with you like
          rearranging and adding furniture and plants :) I absolutley cannot freaking wait to live with you. You are so perfect, and I
          could not imagine living life without you. One day we are even going to have these little creatures running around that are
          half me and half you! They are going to be so cute because we will make them out of love and discharge! Hehe, I just love you
          so much my sexy girl. There is so much to be excited about :)

        <p>Love, Officer Poopy</p>
