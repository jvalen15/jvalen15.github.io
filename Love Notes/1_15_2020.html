        <p>Dear, LSU Girl <br><br>

          Good news, honey. I have adopted you into the LSU family :) You are now an honorary member of the Tiger
          family hehe. Sorry about it, I make the rules now muahahaha. I guess it is time for us to get matching
          tiger pajamas. It's the right thing to do. I hope you're having fun with Meagan!! I'm glad you have a buddy with
          you so you're not all lonesome in that big house :) I'm really really looking forward to being with you this
          weekend!!! It's going to be so exciting to move you into your new living space! You are going to thrive these next
          couple of years, honey bo. I will try my darndest to get a job near you, bubby. I really want to spend more time
          with you. I just miss you so much and I miss your face and your touch!! This semester seems like it's going
          to be a bit hard for me, but I'm sure it will go by quickly, and you'll help me through it with your love and
          support, Julia :) How about another quote aboout how much I miss you.

          Ahhh poetry to our lonely ears. We really do miss each other so much, but lucky for us, our moment of
          happiness and bliss when we hug and kiss each other is so close that I could taste it! (And smell it,
          too because it's a tinky moment hehe). I can't wait to just cuddle with you without a care in the world.
          That is true bliss for me. I love you, Julia :) We have so much to look forward to :)

        <p>Love, LSU Boi</p>
