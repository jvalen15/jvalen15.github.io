        <p>Dear, Sneezy<br><br>

          How in the world did you go on in life without have last week's love letter? I hope since this love letter took
          two weeks to make, that it is double the amazing for you. I miss having you around. I miss waking up next to
          you and pulling you closer and holding you tight. I miss all the kind words you tell me on an hourly basis.
          Long distance is both a blessing and a curse, but recently it has been more of a curse than ever. I mean,
          we spent about 10 days together and we were already missing each other so much that night and the
          next morning. The food pictures you have been sending me also make me so excited for a future of me
          seeing your food a lot more often. I love you Julia. I want that we are kind to each other and do stuff
          for each other forever. Not because it will keep our love strong, but because our love IS strong. Time
          for a very apt love quote.

          "Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love." - Lao Tzu
          <br><br>

          We are both such kind people, and that is one of your qualities that I fell in love with most. Heck, you even
          convinced me to become a devout vegan so early on because it is the kind and right thing to do. I just think that is
          amazing. I hope that this COVID-19 thing really puts it into perspective the disasters and lack of rights that
          animals have to deal with every second. Anyway, I miss you, and I hope to be with you soon as the world
          continues to fall to pieces. Having each other during times like these is the single most important thing. Ooh, I
          have also just started working on your birthday present. You are going to love it :)

        <p>Love, a boy who misses you very much </p>
