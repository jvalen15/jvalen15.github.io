        <p>Dear, Vally girl <br><br>

          I’m a day late for the second time ever!!!! Ahhhhh it’s the end of the world!!
          This is actually the first ever love letter that I am writing from my phone!
          I bet I won’t have any grammar mistakes muahahaha.
          My legs are going to be very sore after my workout so there will be no
          jumping on me tonight....unless you want to bring me down lol.
          The koala strikes back! Sounds like a movie title hehe.
          Well, honey, I don't have much time to write this love letter, but you better expect an amazing one
          on Christmas Day :) How about a love quote?
