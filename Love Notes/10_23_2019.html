        <p>Dear, Cuddle Buddy <br><br>

          Whew! 7 days already?! Looks like someone has an incoming lovey letter! LOVE LETTER 20 WOO-HOO!
          I'm not the best texter (Let's
          be honest, I tink at texting), but I do love to write you a love letter :) I wish my laptop was my phone. I would
          be bomb at texting if I could use a keyboard! I know you still feel bad bubby, but how about you think about how
          amazing your visit was instead of thinking about the one little blemish (It's time we fixate on the positive things
          instead of the negatives). You spontaneously drove two and a half hours to come see me, you offer to pay for everything
          even when you know that you have no money, you made my room look all nice for me today, you give me all the love in the
          world when we are together, and you gave me some of the best memories ever on this surprise visit (I loved our date on the lake).
          I will always focus on all the good that you do for me, oh love of mine. I just think the absolute world of you. It's about
          damn time for a quote.

          You are my type. I love everything about you. I love everything you do for me. Your face? My type.  Your butt? My type.
          Your laugh? My type. The things you get excited about? My type. Your boobies? Definitely my type. I am more in love
          with you than I have ever been, and it can only go up from here. I'm so happy to be able to continue to grow with you
          even more. I miss you already, and I cannot wait to see you this weekend. Uwu. Hehe.

        <p>Love, Bagel Boy</p>
