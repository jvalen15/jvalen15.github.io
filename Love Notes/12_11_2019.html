        <p>Dear, Bewbz <br><br>

          I'm just sitting here listening to fox news with my parents lol. It's the perfect time to write up a love letter
          that is almost overdue :). I think I might have had one of the best nights ever with you last night and one of the
          best mornings ever with you. SO MANY AMAZING GROGGY CUDDLES!!! *HEART* *HEART* *KISS* *KISS* I love how we were able
          to bounce back so quickly from what you thought would be a "ruined" night. We did so amazing last night, and I am so
          thankful for our dynamics and how we take care of things. I just keep on falling more and more in love with you. I
          can't wait to "watch movies with you all the time." I have been getting so many interesting vibes lately that seem
          to hint at someone wanting to name their kid, "Jimmy" lately. It's a very interesting name hmmmmmmmm. I do agree though,
          it would be one of the cutest names ever for a boy, even if it is just a nickname for James. I am really looking forward
          to our Christmas break together. We are going to have such a fun time. We have to plan a trip before our DC trip is
          over or else we won't have a future trip planned!!! It seems like we always have a trip planned so we must. Anyway, it is
          about god darn time for a love quote!

          "My love started as a snowflake. Now it's just an avalanche of love." - Anthony T. Hincks
          <br><br>

          IT'S OUR GUY!!! ANTHONY TINKS!!! I thought this quote was just so perfect because of the snow we had this morning.
          It was a light snow, but my love for you really is an avalanche on Mount Everest :))) My love for you is over-flowing
          just like the blood from your private area hehehehe. I love you bubby. Thank you for always loving me unconditionally.
          You are the freaking best. I love us, and I can't wait for our future. 

        <p>Love, Ballz</p>
