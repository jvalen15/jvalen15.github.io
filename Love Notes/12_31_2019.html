        <p>Dear, Big Bewbz <br><br>

          Wow, today is the last day of this decade :) We better make it count! I can't wait to hang out with you today, my love.
          I have had the most wonderful Christmas break with you. It was definitely my favorite Christmas yet :))) I loved hanging out with
          you and your family. It is always such a treat. Remind me to thank your parents for all that they do! I'm sorry that
          such an amazing trip had a bit of a hiccup on our car ride when I made that insensitive tweet, my love. I also was not
          composed when we were talking about it. I hope you can forgive me and we can move on. I love our relationship, love.
          I wouldn't trade what we have for the world! I can guarantee you that no matter how many times we get "weird" at each, that
          we will continue to be so so so in love with each other :) I'm all in if you are all in Mrs. Valentine :) Time for a quote!

          Thank you for that wonderful quote, Jor Pod, I'm sure Juul Pod will enjoy that one! 2020 is going to be one for the
          books for us my love :) We are going to be further away from each other than ever! But I know it will only make
          our relationship stronger. I just can't wait until we are super close to each other one day. Ya know, like in the
          same bed close ;) HAHA I love you, Julia. I just want to make sure that you know how much I am invested in us, and
          how my feelings for you and my thoughts about you are unchanged and I am the luckiest guy in the world :)))

        <p>Love, Lil Ballz</p>
