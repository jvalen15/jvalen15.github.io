        <p>Dear, Future Wifey<br><br>

          OMG, maybe you should start expecting me to be late on your love letters every now and then! I of course will try not
          to be late, but sometimes I get distracted from it! My overall goal for your love letters is to get you 52 love letters
          per year :) That means in 20 years that you'll have over 1,000 love letters from me!!! WOAH! So many :) I wonder how
          bald I will be by then hehe. I'm so freaking happy to be here just writing this love letter from the comfort of your
          bed. Your bed is definitely one of my favorite happy places that I know of. There will never be anything more comfy
          than your bed, but it would be even more comfy if you were here in it with me right now :) I just love you so much, Julia.
          Each month I fall more in love with you. Each week I fall more in love with you. Each day I fall more in love with you.
          Each hour I fall more in love with you. Each minute I fall more in love with you. Each second I fall more in love with you.
          I'm going to love the fuck out of you forever. Here's a love quote :)

          <br><br>
          "If you find someone you love in your life, then hang on to that love." - Princess Diana
          <br><br>

          MUAHAHA I found a love quote by Princess Diana! I found the woman I love in life, and you are god damn right that I am
          going to cling on to her for the rest of my days, Diana. She is beautiful, cunning, funny, honest, and loving. I am going to fucking
          cherish that woman. Her name is Julia, and I am in love with her :)

        <p>Love, Future Hubby</p>
