        <p>Dear, Julia Valenhood<br><br>
          I BET YOU WEREN'T EXPECTING A LOVE LETTER TODAY MUAHAHAHAHA. I like doing cute things for you
          that will be sure to catch you off guard. I miss your tinky butt so much, my love. WHY IS IT SO HARD
          FOR US TO GO ONE WEEKEND WITHOUT SEEING EACH OTHER? Wow, I really am so so in love with you. It is going
          to be so easy and so exciting to actually get to live with you one day! Things are going to go so
          smoothly with us :). Our lives will have their ups and downs, but WE will always have each other
          to help get us through the downs. I cannot afford to ever lose you my sweetness. You are by far my
          greatest accomplishment hehe. <br> LOVE QUOTE TIME <br> <br> “The Sun may light up the sky,
          but you light up my life.” - Anthony T Hincks <br><br> OMG. You could read his name as ANTHONY TINKS!
          BAHAHAHA. But seriously, your smile brightens my day so much, and you brighten my day so much without even
          trying to. I just love you so darn much. I loved our phone calls today. It's so refreshing to
          hear your voice when I miss you this much. You are the best lava anyone could ever ask for.
        <br><br>Love,<br>Jordan Hoodentine</p>
