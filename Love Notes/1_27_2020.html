        <p>Dear, Sex <br><br>

          I had the most wonderful weekend ever with you :) It was a lazy, but eventful weekend
          and I enjoyed every freaking second of it :) I think museums should 100% become our thing in the future. That is such a
          nice, healthy, and rewarding thing to have as ours. It would also continue to be nice even when we have our little kiddos in the
          picture :) Next time you visit, the house will 1 million percent be cleaner!! It will be my mission to clean it the day before
          you get here! You have my word, love :) Anyway this will be a different kind of love letter. This love letter will include my 11
          pictures from this weekend!!! I love you bunz :))))) (P.S. ONE OF THE PHOTOS IS NSFW)
