        <p>Dear, Wilmington Gal <br><br>

          Honey, I just really miss you so much right now. Thank you so much for taking care of me while
          I was sickly, my love. You let me take lots of breaks, you kept offering me snacks and water, you
          ran me a bath, and you really loved on me (while giving me space when I wanted it :) ). You are just so
          amazing to me, and I hope to be just as amazing to you, hot stuff :) I'm sorry that today was extra stressful
          for you; I wish I could have been there to help you through it, but I'm glad you and your dad are sorting
          everything out. I really cannot wait to hang out with you and explore a new city with you. It's going to be so much fun
          my love. I am going to enjoy all of our time with each other walking around campus and eating vegan burritos :)
          I know I was griping about having the lan tournament on the day I'm helping you move in again, but I am
          happy to help, and I'm looking forward to seeing you way more than playing smash :)

          <br><br>

          It means you had someone special in your life, someone worth missing." - Nikki Schiefelbein

          I really super love this quote :) We complain about missing each other, but it is so nice to have
          someone that I care this deeply about :) I miss you, and that's a good thing :) We are lucky. I am lucky.
          I am so lucky I have someone who not only puts up with my tinkyness, but also decides to love me back!
          Wow, do I have it good, or what? Hehe in conclusion, I miss my love, and that's okay :) But, man oh man,
          I cannot wait to hug you next. I hope your first week of school goes amazing hun :)

        <p>Love, Charlotte Boi</p>
