        <p>Dear Bonk Bink,<br><br>

          Happy "Us Day" again my lava :) Sorry I was late to getting you this love letter, I have had tendencies of being quite the slacker lately hehe! I hope that this love letter does show you that I love and care about you so much and I will take care of you always as you are my precious woman. I hope it also shows that I am serious about being better about doing the things that I say I will do, and listening to you better :)



Wow, bunny, this was our first Valentine’s Day as a married couple! I enjoyed it so much and I’m happy we found such a good show to watch on our special day. I also can’t wait to work on our puzzle tonight! Eeeeep! Next year we will wake up in the same bed with Valentine as both of our last names!



I hope work went well, Instacart has been going well so far! It’s always nice starting with a thirty dollar order muahahaha. Well here’s a love quote:



<br>"Where there is love, there is life." - Gandhi <br>



Wow this Gandhi guy is on to something. No matter what we go through in life, as long as we have each other and our love, then we will have life :)) I just love you so much, Julia, and I don’t want to take you for granted! I will try to show you my love in more ways so you can feel loved and taken care of! This love letter is a step in that direction. I love you baby.

        <p>Love, Bink Bonk</p>
