        <p>Dear, Cool Jules <br><br>
          This is a love letter from the tinkiest bubby of them all. Every tinky bubby strives to be as tinky as I am, so you
          should be honored to even be in the presence of my tinkiness. Thank you for never calling my breath tinky in the morning! You're
          always so sweet to me, my lava. I cannot wait to cuddle you this weekend!!! This Love Letter is going to be like no other!!! Down below
          you have the choice to pick between four different authors of some nice love quotes that I feel are so sweet and so "us". Well, get to it bubby!
