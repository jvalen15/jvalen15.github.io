        <p>Dear Bubby Bee Bubby Boo,</br></br>
          I am 3 days late on my love letter....ahhhhhh! BUT, this is the first day of us having
          wee-fee, so it isn't all my fault! It has been a very busy last few days making this house
          actually feel like home, but we have been doing a great job. You were such a big help (even
          though you kept apologizing for not doing more) last weekend :) I literally could not have
          moved in without your help. It is still crazy to me that so many of my thought processes have you in
          mind. "What would Julia think about this." or "I wish Julia were here to see this." I am just so obsessed with
          my tinky, tinky girl :)))). I miss you so much and I miss you so much and I miss you so much! I cannot wait for you to
          visit this weekend. We are going to have such a BWAST. ALSO, thank you again for that video you made me, it
          is so thoughtful and sweet. </br></br> TIME FOR A QUOTE: </br></br> "We’re all a little weird. And life is a little weird.
          And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall into mutually
          satisfying weirdness—and call it love—true love."</br></br> I like this quote; it reminds me a lot of us ;) I hope work
          is going well bubbs, I can't wait to canoodle the fuck out of you.

        </br></br>Love,</br> Your tinkyness</p>
