        <p>Dear, Hot 'Tuff<br><br>

          Two love letters in a row??? What is this, Christmas??? Haha yesterday I said to expect another love letter
          today and I really felt like sticking to my word on this one :) Earlier I said that I was lacking motivation (The
          coffee did help haha), but then I remembered that you are one of my biggest motivators. My dream in life is to live
          it with you *Heart Emoji* As long as I have you, then everything else will fall into place. My last love letter didn't have as
          much writing in it, so it's only right that you receive one that is actually a letter lol. I'm really excited to hang out
          with you and your mommy this weekend. I wasn't lying when I said that your parents were my favorite couple to hang
          out with, but I love hanging out with all your coupled friends :) Jake & Holly, Jessie & Jonny, & even Hannah & Keith hehe.
          Anyway, I would love to take this time to reassure you that what we have is nothing like I have ever had with anyone.
          I have never been this in love with anyone, and 99% of the things we have done together have been a new experience for me.
          I can also assure you that I would never want what we have with anyone else ever. You are my other half, and you are
          what I want for the rest of my life :)

          Mister Jimmy Storm really summed all of this up better than I ever could :) You are the reason I am the way I am
          around you. I would never be that way with any other girl :) YOU are my girl and you will always be my girl :) I love
          you oh so much, Julia. I cannot wait to hang this weekend *Big Ole Heart Emoji*

        <p>Love, Butt 'Tuff</p>
