        <p>Dear, LOML <br><br>

          *Takes sip* Ahhh, I bet you missed a more traditional love letter, didn't you? Well, it is time for an
          ooey-gooey mushy wushy lovey dovey love letter :). We just literally had the best vacay ever!!! I cannot
          even begin to explain how in love with you I am. From start to finsih, the Holden Beach trip was just
          a blast! Apartment Shopping, IndoChine, Yahtzee, Chicken Biscuits, Sexy Sex, Tooting, College Football,
          Cuddles, the rain, sharing food, Whole Foods, your parents... IT WAS JUST SO FUN! Ooh, and how could
          I almost forget! Our car rides with lots of scary stories and crimes!!! Wow, I just keep falling in love with
          you. I must have fallen like a billion miles by now hehe. I love our relationship. I love how we handle things,
          and I love how we handle each other with care. You are so considerate and kind that it blows my mind. OOH THAT
          RHYMED. OOH AND "RHYMED" ALSO RHYMED. OOH AND...haha okay, I'll chill. You seriously amaze me every day. I
          can't believe little ole' Asheboro was holding a gem as bright and shiny as you. I think you know what time it is...

          <br><br>
          "The hours I spend with you I look upon as sort of a perfumed garden, a dim twilight, and a fountain
          singing to it. You and you alone make me feel that I am alive.
          Other men it is said have seen angels, but I have seen thee and thou art enough." - George Edward Moore
          <br><br>

          Ahhh, excuse the old timey talk, but this guy gets it! George Edward has a way with words, doesn't he?
          Haha he sure does, lava. Anyway, I think I've said enough, I wouldn't want to get carried away and write
          two love letters on accident, now would I? Oh what's that? Are you saying that I would want to do that?
          Hmmmm, I feel as if you are trying to get me to do that... Hmmmmmmmmm, something's up with bobby. NEHHH, I
          JUST CAN'T PUT MY FINGER ON IT. Hehehe I hope you enjoyed your traditional Love Letter :)

        <p>Love, Your Llama</p>
