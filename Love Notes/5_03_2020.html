        <p>Dear, Wunky Tunky<br><br>

          Is this the longest you have ever had to wait for a love letter! I bet it is! I am finally done with my semester for college. One more class! EEEEEEP. Go me!
          Now that I am done with skrewl for a bit, I can get right back into loving my girlfriend as much as I possibly can, and that means you get a much deserved love letter!
          Thank you so much for visiting this weekend. It truly meant the world to have you here these past few days. I had so much drinking, cuddling, napping, and being your teammate
          for the quarantine olympics this weekend :) You brought home the only gold medal for France, and you made the best T-shirt I have ever seen for me! Gawd Damn, I love you more than
          ever! And that love is only going to continue to go up :) All the peoples are downstairs right now, and I have them convinced I still have a little bit of homework left, but really
          I'm just writing you a love letter saying how much I appreciate you :) You do so much, and I promise you that I notice every little bit of it!

          This quote wasn't super relevant to anything, but I just thought it was the cutest fucking thing ever. I guess it could be relevant to us living together in the near future! HEHE I can't
          wait. I don't care where we live together as long as I get to be with you. TINY HOUSE HERE WE COME. Haha, just kidding, although, I wouldn't mind it :) I just love you so much, my love.
          Before you know it, we are going to be living together, and then engaged, and then married, and then have a kid :) EEEEEEP Let's savor every freaking moment together :)

        <p>Love, Bubby Wubby</p>
