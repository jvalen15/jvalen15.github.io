        <p>Dear Bubby,</br></br>
        I'm so very happy to hear that you will be able to go to UNC Wilmington
        if you choose to do so! That is so exciting :) I bet you will end up doing that, and I'm
        sure your parents will be so happy to be near you! Bill is always telling me to look
        for jobs in Raleigh because then I will close to you while you are at UNCW. He says the
        area is absolutley beautiful, too. If I do find work there, then I could also go to NC State
        if I want to get my Master's Degree! I hope you are enjoying your vacation with ArtPod and
        MarePod. I miss you sooooooooooooooooooooooo much *Heart Emoji*. I can't wait to go up North
        with my best friend forever. Hanging out with Jonathan makes me realize how close I am to you, and
        how similar we are. There have been so many things that he has said that have warranted an
        eyebrow raise from me. I wish you could be here so we could exchange the same look to each
        other haha. Jonathan was really laughing hard at some David Dobrik videos while we were
        drunk last night. I think that he thinks Jason is the funniest member of the Vlog Squad.
        I just want you to know that I am the proudest boyfriend in the world, and I am the absolute
        luckiest person in the world to be your partner hehe. I can't wait for our future together, near
        and far. I will love you until the end of time. I cannot wait to
        be so super weird with you and continue to not give a care what other
        people think :) As Paul Valery once said, “Love is being stupid together.” 
        </br></br> Love,</br> Other Bubby.</p>
