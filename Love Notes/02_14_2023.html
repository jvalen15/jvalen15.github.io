        <p>Dear Julia Valentine,<br><br>

          It has been far too long since I’ve written you a love letter, but if there were ever a time to write you one, then it’s on our special day :)

          I hope you like the treats I’ve gotten you and I’m sorry for no flowers on our special day. Maybe I’ll get you some after work!

          I love you and I am looking forward to many more Valentine’s Days with you. Love Quote time!

          You amaze me with the work you do and I think you so much for making the moneys for the past 5 months.

          I hope you keep at it with making me proud with not smoking and drinking. You are my loml and the future mother of my kid(s). Love you babe.


        <p>Love, Jordan Valentine</p>
