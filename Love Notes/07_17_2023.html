        <p>Dear Wife of mine,<br><br>

          It's love note time!! I think I said, "If you don't have a love note by Monday, then something is wrong." AND NOW IT'S MONDAY!

          I am so so so proud of you, my love. You are truly making strides recently, and even though you feel like you have been rude/mean to me at times,

          you are still recognizing it and working on yourself. You are/have been going through a very rough time in your life so I can understand the stress of it all.

          We will always have our marriage and our friendship to get us through tough times. Even when the tough times have to deal with our relationship, we will still put "us" first.


          <br><br>"To be your friend was all I ever wanted; to be your lover was all I ever dreamed." - Valerie Lombardo <br><br>

          Again, I am so proud of you, and I am just so hopeful about us moving forward. Congratulations on putting in your two weeks notice my love :)

          It is a little stressful, but what's done is done, and I am happy for you, and we will make things work :)


        <p>Love, Husband of yours</p>
