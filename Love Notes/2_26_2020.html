        <p>Dear, Woman that I miss so much<br><br>

          Ahh, today is Cole's birthday! I have never missed anyone or anything so much in my entire life, and I've been to freaking India for a month.
          I missed America so flipping much. I miss you more than when I didn't see my dad for almost two years...AND IT'S
          ONLY BEEN 10 FLIPPING DAYS!!! I just miss all of the cuddles, the jokes, the making up of words and phrases, the
          amazing food you make, your beautiful smile, your sexy body, your boobies and your butt, your sweet kisses, and you
          jumjping into my arms! Gosh, I have it so good with you :) Well, Julia I'm 1 day late on my love letter. You need a bit of love letter in your life, tbh. OOH, I just remembered the most
          important thing of all. I MISS YOUR TINKYNESS. I don't think there could be anything better than your tink. It is perfect.
          Oh so smelly and yummy. Here is a love quote from a very famous author!

          <br><br>
          "I love you and I'm sorry you have to remind me for the Love Letters." - Jordan (Your Bubby)
          <br><br>

          Wow, I can't believe I was able to get such a famous author for that quote. It's real hard to get
          in contact with that guy hehe. I really am the luckiest guy in the world to be able to date my best friend.
          You are so damn perfect, and we are perfect for each other, nothing could ever convince me otherwise.
          I can't wait for the day that I actually get you pregnant for realz. It is going to be the best day of
          my life. Well, after the wedding. The wedding will be the best day of my life for sure. I hope you enjoyed your
          late love letter! Hopefully it was worth the wait :))))

        <p>Love, Boy that misses you so much </p>
