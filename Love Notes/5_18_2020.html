        <p>Dear, Mother of Jimmy<br><br>

          Ahhh a lot has happened since my last love letter! You wrote me scary messages on your fogged up bathroom mirror like, "Jordan goes first."
          We nailed down your outdoor rug, we looked at some apartments and fell in love with Beau Rivage :) We started experimenting more with TikTok hehe, we
          had lots of fuhn exciting sexy times, we hung out with Dakotah and bunch, we bought a Jimmy AND planted him, WE WATCHED STAR WARS TOGETHER, we watched more
          Dead To Me, but I had downloaded some addicting games to my computer so I had gotten absorbed by those hehe. Man, we really do a lot, don't we? :) I
          always want to do new things with you and experience everything with you. You are the most fun person in the world to share moments with. I am so fucking happy,
          and I thank whatever higher power that I need to be thanking that the stars aligned for us to be lovers :) I will never be complacent with you, and I will take
          care of you for the rest of our days. You are my prized medalion. My "One in a quadrillion." :))))

          This one is cute and sad, but I like it a lot. It doesn't have to just be being afraid to sleep alone, it can be being afraid to do a lot of things alone. We are
          both our own persons who go off on our own a lot, but going off on our own can still be scary without our love. Remember, we are truly just two bunnies trying to find love in this cruel world.
          We found love, and now we get savor and cherish our love, we will never take one another for granted. I love you, Julia :) Forever and ever :)

        <p>Love, Father of Faye</p>
