        <p>Dear, Full Head of Hair Girl<br><br>

          Ahhh it's definitely Love Letter time. You are just so due for one as it has been one week, but you are also due for some good old
          fashioned appreciation. Everyday I am just so thankful that *fate* lead us together, and that we get to call each other, "mine." You
          are seriously the best thing that has EVER happened to me. I don't know where I would be without you. You are just so flipping thoughtful,
          understanding, loving, kind, amazing, hard-working, and many more awesome things :) God Damn! I just love you and appreciate the absolute
          fuckle out of you!!! I feel like this is the most in tune with each other we have ever been, and it can only get better from here :) Heck,
          we might have had the MOST interactions where we think/say the EXACT same thing at the EXACT same time this weekend. Wow, we must be soul
          mates. You have also just shown me so much and influenced me in so many good ways. I would definitely not have a favorite volleyball player
          if it wasn't for you. Which by the way, I am about to watch a new Yuji Nishida Highlight reel. Godddddd I love you, Julia :)

          Bet you didn't see that love quote coming hahaha. This is almost just like what you were talking about with the whole "loving someone
          isn't enough, you have to really like the person, too." thing. We have to continue to not only be each other's romantic lovers, but to also
          be each other's best friends forever!! I love you, best friend. Forever and ever :)

        <p>Love, Bald Boi</p>
