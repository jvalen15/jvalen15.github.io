        <p>Dear Stressy (Always Lovable) Girl,<br><br>

          It has been over two months since I last wrote you a love letter!!! These love letters were always such an amazing way of consistently showing you how much I care about you at all times :)
          I'd say it's about damn time you received one of these suckers! Right now you are still at work, and I am preparing for our trip to Charlotte! I am super excited, but I am oh so sad that
          school is piling up and stressing you out. I will try and be the most helpful bubby ever to you while you are finishing up all of your assignments, and who knows? Maybe some of the teachers will
          accept late work. Love, it has been such a treat living with my romantic partner and best friend. I know your brain might like to tell you that I'd be better off without you sometimes, but you listen here,
          butt stuff! I don't know what I would do without you. I need you more than you need me! You are my other half, and trust me, I'm not going anywhere, ever. In our lives, we will accomplish our goals, we will
          travel all around the world, we will make the best memories ever, and we will do it all together. It's you and me baby. I love you more than all of the plankton in the sea. I can't wait for our trip together.
          It is going to be such a bwast!

        <p>Love, Elizabeth's hugging tree</p>
