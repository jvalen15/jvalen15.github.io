        <p>Dear, Hood <br><br>

          Wowwwwwwwww, I never thought I could miss anyone or anything as much as I miss you right now!
          I have been so deprived of you in the past 9 days. I need cuddles. I need canoodles. I need kisses.
          I need love making. I NEED MY BUBBY. Hehe, I can't wait for these next couple of nights with you :) It is
          going to be so relieving, and it is going to be such a nice change of pace. I hope we can get drunk and dance the
          night away :))) I can already see the future where we both come home after long days at work and jump on the bed and
          get right to canoodling. I just love you so much, lovey. I've really been craving those chicken biscuits love. They
          were so darn good. OOH! Can we make pigs in a blanket this weekend??? I really want some pigs in a blanket. Hey, they
          would be a really good drunk food! Muahaha. It's going to be really nice to enjoy the cold weather with you again :) It's
          nice to be able to be there for each other when we need warming up :) I can't wait to spend my first Christmas with you
          this year!!! EEP. I should get you another shirt with Ellie on it. HAHAHA. Oh, how we miss her :) Anyway, it's about
          time for one of those lovey dovey quotes that describes our love :)

          <br><br>
          "Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies." - Aristotle
          <br><br>

          Being in love takes  two people :) Our love is one. It just includes the both of us. We are our own individuals,
          but I like us better together. We always long for each other. We don't "need" each other, but man oh man do I love
          having each other. I actually do think I need you hehe. You're mine forever. We are one :) One day we are going to come
          together as one through a certain traditional ritual muahahaha. :))) I know that one will make you scream! You're my
          forever *Heart*



        <p>Love, Valentine</p>
