        <p>Dear, Julia Hood<br><br>
          I am a procrastinating college student, and I have finally gotten around to completing my love
          letter assignment! HAHA JUST KIDDING. I would never look at this as homework or a chore :) I have been
          very busy lately (and very tired) with life things, but I must never forget that you are the biggest
          priority in my life. I really do enjoy writing ooey gooey things to you, and I love to write and tell
          people about you. I miss you a lot, and I really want to play/watch volleyball with you. You have made me enjoy
          so many things in life that I never appreciated before in the past: Volleyball, Thai Food, Different
          Studio Ghibli Movies, Psyduck, Traveling, Camping, and I'm sure there are many more examples :) We become
          more like each other the more we grow together. THAT SHOULD BE A LOVE QUOTE! I made it up hehe. I really
          liked the Beach Boys thing you sent me today. I always daydream about our future together. You are the best
          thing to ever happen to me, and you are god damn right I will keep you for as long as I live muahahaha.
          Like it or not, you are stuck with me ;))) 
        <br><br>Love,<br>Jordan Valentine</p>
