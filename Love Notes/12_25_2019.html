        <p>Dear, Max <br><br>

          MERRY CHRISTMAS YA FILTHY ANIMAL :) I don't have much time if I am going to keep this as a love letter that
          gets delivered on Christmas Day, but I am going to make this one count!! WOW... I have had an amazing Christmas
          break with you. I am absolutely just so ecstatic that we got to spend so much good, quality time with each other
          before you move down to Filmington. The Christmas Story movie was so good, and the food was to die for. Early Christmas
          turned out to be so refreshing and fun. We had freaking amazing talks on our drives that made the car rides go by
          lightning quick. I had the most fun ever at Jessie's house with you, your friends, and Mark & Michelle. Dave and
          Busters was probably the most fun thing in the Universe. OOH! And how could I almost forget your sacrifice to let me
          go see Star Wars!!! Ahhh, that was so sweet, even if you got a good nap in, hehe :) I'll never forget our Never Have I
          Ever drinking games with that one married couple we hang out with, and showing people Jackbox games. You got me to go
          downtown to go try a super cute donut place, and I am so thankful you do things like that for me. It led me to seeing
          a super cute proposal that gave me lots of insight and ideas. Ahhhhh the moments leading up to Christmas Day were just
          so amazing with you :)

          Christmas Day turned out to be so cute and so much fun. It was filled with laughter, Jackbox, yummy food, kisses,
          hugs, toots, and your boyfriend being so hot with how he rolls dice. I cannot thank you enough for being so sweet with
          how many presents you got me. Christmas is about giving, and you have given me so much, and you continue to keep
          giving me more :). I am looking forward so much to our time in DC with your family. I am so grateful to be a part of
          your Christmas Tradition :) I love you Julia, I am truly the luckiest guy in the world :))))))))))))

        <p>Love, Fred</p>
